# Chess-Game
A Python Chess Game, modificated by Khoa Le.

Instruction to install pygame by pip and run the game on virtual environment (venv) if you may need (recommended for MacOS):
1. Run script: [/usr/local/bin/python3 -m venv venv", replace "/usr/local/bin/python3] with your actual local python interpreter (or download one) to create a virtual environment on your device.
2. Run script: source venv/bin/activate.
3. Run script: [pip install pygame] install pygame (by pip) to your virtual environment.
4. Run script: [python "/Users/khoale/Downloads/Chess game python/main.py"], to run your game.

Notice:
Once downloaded, you may have found that your code is stored at a different location to the game setting, please make changes as below to all of your chess-pieces according to your local machine's correct directory to import their image.
For instance, BQ = pygame.image.load('Downloads/Chess game python/Chess_Pieces/bq.png'), replace those in the bracket as your own path.
